### Fig. 2. A consistent video should be 1) style inconsistent 2) content consistent. 
Style consistency requires the whole video sequence to have the same style, thus ensuring the video frames to be overall realistic. Meanwhile, content consistency refers to the appearance continuity of contents in adjacent video frames, which ensures the video sequence to be dynamically vivid.
