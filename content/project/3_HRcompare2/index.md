### Fig. 3. Video of the comparison with RecycleGAN: we aim to compare the content consistency and image-level quality. 
Here the RecycleGAN results are produced by the original RecycleGAN code in a resolution of 256Ã—256. Since there is no guarantee of style consistency for RecycleGAN, we select some Re-cycleGAN visual results in a small sequence length of 30 frames where style is almost consistent to compare with UVIT (ours).
