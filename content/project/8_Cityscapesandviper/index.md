### Fig.8. Video of Cityscapes-and-Viper translation. 
Top left: real Cityscapes input; Top right: translated Viper videos with different style codes; Bottom left: real Viper input; Bottom right:  translated Cityscapes videos with different style codes.  Since the general distribution between Cityscapes and Viper may be different (e.g. there are more buildings in Cityscapes), the translated Viper video may differ from input Cityscapes video in class distribution to fool the discriminator, so as to be close to the class distribution in the target domain.
